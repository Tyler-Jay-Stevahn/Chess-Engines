# Chess-Engines
Just a list of chess engines I have made and the python behind them

Random_moves.py Literally just makes random moves.
- Note: only works with computer vs computer matches in some GUI's.
    - it has issues with player versus computer matches after moves because it just stops playing and you have to stop/start it to get it to play each move.
    - has good stability with CuteChess GUI
    - has bad stability with Banksiagui
    - does not have any scoring method for moves
Test.py currently is messing around with a scoring method.
- Note: this is still in the testing phase and it is using the Randm_moves.py as a baseline.
