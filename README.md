# Chess-Engines
Just a list of chess engines I have made and the python behind them

Random_moves.py Literally just makes random moves.
- Note: only works with computer vs computer matches in some GUI's.
    - it has issues with player versus computer matches after moves because it just stops playing and you have to stop/start it to get it to play each move.
